# Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs

## About the course   
This course is a practical and beginner-friendly introduction to supervised machine learning, decision trees, and gradient boosting using Python. In this course, I will solve 2 coding assignments and build a course project where I will train ML models using a large real-world dataset.
